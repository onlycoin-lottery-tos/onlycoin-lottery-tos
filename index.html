            <p class="font-bold text-lg mb-2 text-gray-200">Executive Summary: The Foundational Legal Blueprint for Institutional Viability</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300">The OnlyCoins project is built upon a compliance-first posture, utilizing a sophisticated two-token ecosystem to separate regulatory risks. <code>$ONLYCOINS</code> is engineered as a cultural, community-driven, entertainment-focused asset, employing the "For Entertainment Purposes Only" (FEO) framework to mitigate unregistered securities risks. Conversely, <code>$VERITAS</code> is positioned as a utility-driven, professionally engineered financial instrument—the foundational payment rail for the "Reimbursement Economy." This dual architecture provides a legally sound defense against global regulatory scrutiny, appealing directly to institutional requirements for accountability and long-term viability.</p>

            <h4 class="section-subtitle text-xl">I. Strategic Delineation: A Masterclass in Regulatory Risk Compartmentalization</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-300">The two-token architecture is a calculated legal maneuver designed to manage risk exposure and appeal to distinct investor archetypes by strategically compartmentalizing risk exposure to the U.S. SEC’s Howey Test. The on-chain capital generated by the <code>$ONLYCOINS</code> ecosystem funds the compliance and development of the <code>$VERITAS</code> token.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300">The legal framework for <code>$ONLYCOINS</code> mitigates risks of classification as an unregistered security (SEC) and an illegal gambling operation by establishing clear legal boundaries from the outset. It explicitly states the token is "not a security" and utilizes the FEO defense to counter the "expectation of profits" prong of the Howey Test.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">The project uses the "Chuck E. Cheese tokens" analogy to position the token's utility as intrinsic to a closed, entertainment-based ecosystem.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300">The "Reimbursement Economy" is the project’s most potent competitive and legal differentiator for <code>$VERITAS</code>. The utility is proven by offsetting the exorbitant fees charged by traditional centralized platforms using the rewards generated by the <code>$ONLYCOINS</code> ecosystem. This verifiable utility proves that <code>$VERITAS</code>’s value is derived from its function as essential infrastructure, not from speculative investment, countering the Howey Test for this asset.</p>
            
            <h4 class="section-subtitle text-xl">IV. The Technical Blueprint: Engineering for Regulatory Compliance</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-300">The architecture is designed to support legal, compliance, and economic requirements. The hybrid multi-chain architecture (Solana for core logic/low-cost and Polygon for payment rail/EVM compatibility) provides a compelling legal argument that the project is a functional business model dependent on specific blockchain capabilities.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300">The project's security posture has been optimized to protect all community assets. The new lottery treasury wallet system is now live and has been designed to operate under a continuous, formal protocol to mitigate security risks. The former lottery address has been decommissioned, and all significant assets have been moved to a new, secure cold storage solution.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">The new, publicly published treasury wallet address is: <code class="bg-gray-700 p-1 rounded-md text-blue-300">5hfkxGnMsGR4ka3nKWKWWy3yvVjnzcFoDix7NLHnKEpT</code>.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">This new system is based on a three-part protocol for a robust, multi-layered defense:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>Implementation of a Rotational Wallet:</strong> The new public-facing lottery wallet is a rotational configuration. This system requires a biweekly moving of funds from the lottery wallet to the project treasury. This distributes control, drastically reduces the risk of a single point of compromise, and provides a robust defense against insider threats or the loss of a single private key.</li>
                <li><strong>Formal Rotation Protocol:</strong> A regular, scheduled protocol for rotating the public-facing lottery wallet address has been established and will be documented for the community. A weekly or bi-weekly rotation, coupled with a verifiable announcement, will significantly reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to execute a malicious transaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Communication Protocol:</strong> A verifiable and standardized method for announcing new lottery wallet addresses to the community has been created. All public announcements of a new address will be signed with the project's official private key, which can be verified on-chain, or published on a dedicated, secure page on the official website. This protocol mitigates the risk of participants sending funds to a fraudulent address and builds trust by proving the authenticity of all public communications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">By adopting this professional security posture, the project not only protects its assets but also reinforces its commitment to transparency and community safety, solidifying its reputation as a legitimate and secure ecosystem.</p>
