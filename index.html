            <p class="text-gray-300">The Lottery is a community incentive program and does not constitute gambling, financial advice, or an investment contract. The NFT Passes are considered digital collectibles that grant access to community features; they are not financial instruments, securities, or shares. The project is for entertainment purposes only, and participation is entirely voluntary.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">By participating in the Lottery or purchasing an NFT Pass, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>Not an Investment:</strong> The lottery and NFT Passes do not guarantee any financial returns, profits, or resale value.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The value of $OFC and related digital assets may fluctuate significantly. The OnlyCoins team is not liable for any losses incurred due to price volatility, technological failures, or transaction errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility May Change:</strong> The benefits and utility associated with the NFT Passes (including chat access, multipliers, and cashback) are subject to change, modification, or termination at the sole discretion of the OnlyCoins team, without prior notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Participant Responsibility:</strong> You are solely responsible for ensuring that your participation in the Lottery and your purchase and ownership of NFTs comply with all applicable local laws and regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>No Liability:</strong> The OnlyCoins team assumes no liability for losses or damages incurred through your voluntary participation.</li>
                <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> Winners are solely responsible for any and all applicable taxes in their jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Ownership of an NFT Pass does not transfer any copyright or intellectual property rights to the underlying artwork, brand, or technology, except for personal and non-commercial use.</li>

        <section id="amendments" class="mb-10">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 glitter-text section-title">8. Amendments</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">The OnlyCoins team reserves the right to amend these Terms & Conditions at any time to ensure compliance with evolving regulations, to protect the integrity of the project, and to serve the best interests of the community.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="security" class="mb-10">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 glitter-text section-title">9. Operational and Security Protocol</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-300">The project's security posture has been optimized to protect all community assets. The new lottery treasury wallet system is now live and has been designed to operate under a continuous, formal protocol to mitigate security risks. The former lottery address has been decommissioned, and all significant assets have been moved to a new, secure cold storage solution.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">The new, publicly published treasury wallet address is: <code class="bg-gray-700 p-1 rounded-md text-blue-300">5hfkxGnMsGR4ka3nKWKWWy3yvVjnzcFoDix7NLHnKEpT</code>.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">This new system is based on a three-part protocol for a robust, multi-layered defense:</p>
            <ul class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li><strong>Implementation of a Rotational Wallet:</strong> The new public-facing lottery wallet is a rotational configuration. This system requires a biweekly moving of funds from the lottery wallet to the project treasury. This distributes control, drastically reduces the risk of a single point of compromise, and provides a robust defense against insider threats or the loss of a single private key.</li>
                <li><strong>Formal Rotation Protocol:</strong> A regular, scheduled protocol for rotating the public-facing lottery wallet address has been established and will be documented for the community. A weekly or bi-weekly rotation, coupled with a verifiable announcement, will significantly reduce the window of opportunity for attackers to execute a malicious transaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Communication Protocol:</strong> A verifiable and standardized method for announcing new lottery wallet addresses to the community has been created. All public announcements of a new address will be signed with the project's official private key, which can be verified on-chain, or published on a dedicated, secure page on the official website. This protocol mitigates the risk of participants sending funds to a fraudulent address and builds trust by proving the authenticity of all public communications.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mt-4">By adopting this professional security posture, the project not only protects its assets but also reinforces its commitment to transparency and community safety, solidifying its reputation as a legitimate and secure ecosystem.</p>
